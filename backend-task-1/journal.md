### This is basically a log to keep track of things during the project. Stuff like decisions made, problems faced, solutions, my rapidly declining sanity etc.
- Pulling Postgresql docker image
- Trying to start a docker container
- (Computer had a fucking stroke)
- Decided to do project with Node instead of Django (because I hate myself)
- Started Nodejs setup
- Got a gitignore file
- (Swore at roommate due to wifi problems )
- Installed Apollo server and graphql
- Installing postgresql locally
- Setting up database maindb and initiailizing user and all that stuff
- Store db credentials in .env file (Not really best practice to push db credentials to github repo I know, but IDGAF rn)
- (Waste time on selecting programming playlist) (Kendrick FTW)
- The structure of a "post" will be kinda like twitter, Title and body. Will try to figure out how to use S3 buckets to use images, audio etc.
- Defining queries and mutations for the posts (without using Prisma rn)
- Made basic feed query that basically returns all the posts from an array
- Made a mutation called create that adds post to the afforementioned list
- Adding Prisma
- Also I should separate all the resolvers and shit into separate files, best practices and shit. (UGHH I'll do it later)
- Sort of finished setup for prisma
- Converting from array db to actual postgres db
- Adding Update and Delete resolvers but there some invalid context error
- Apparently when you pass id as an argument, prisma is too dumb to understand that it's a number so I had to use parseInt to fix the problem. No biggie
- CRUD operations complete (more or less)
- Still procrastinating on putting resolvers in separate files
- I should start with Authentication now. Currently in DSA lab, she's explaining linked lists. Battery at 40%, don't know if it'll go till the end of SOOP lab.
- Adding signup and login mutations. Creating user type and linking it to the post type. Updating both schemas.
- Updating mutations and queries so that they check for the JWT. (This shit is confusing AF) (I am facing the consequences of my actions)
- Also yes, JWT because who the hell likes sessions (I don't know, I'm so tired I'm saying bullshit)
- CRUD operations have been implemented with JWT implementation
- Okay wtf, I was testing the queries and suddenly I can't see mutations anywhere
- (For some reason chrome decided to go full on retard mode so) now I'm using firefox for testing
