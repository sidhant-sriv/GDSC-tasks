### This is basically a log to keep track of things during the project. Stuff like decisions made, problems faced, solutions, my rapidly declining sanity etc.
- Pulling Postgresql docker image
- Trying to start a docker container
- Computer had a fucking stroke
- Decided to do project with Node instead of Django because I hate myself
- Started Nodejs setup
- Got a gitignore file
- Swore at roommate due to wifi problems 
- Installed Apollo server and graphql
- Installing postgresql locally
- Setting up database maindb and initiailizing user and all that stuff
- Store db credentials in .env file (Not really best practice to push db credentials to github repo I know, but IDGAF rn)
- Waste time on selecting programming playlist (Kendrick FTW)
- The structure of a "post" will be kinda like twitter, Title and body. Will try to figure out how to use S3 buckets to use images, audio etc.
- Defining queries and mutations for the posts (without using Prisma rn)
- Made basic feed query that basically returns all the posts from an array
- Made a mutation called create that adds post to the afforementioned list
- Adding Prisma
- Also I should separate all the resolvers and shit into separate files, best practices and shit. UGHH I'll do it later
- Sort of finished setup for prisma
